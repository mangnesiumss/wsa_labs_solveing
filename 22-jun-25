ðŸš¨ Why This Is a Real Finding (If in scope)
This is likely a severe vulnerability:

Issue	Why it matters
Unauthenticated sensitive info leak	Server returned tokens, config, and session info without needing valid cookies
JWT tokens with alg: none	Indicates misconfigured or insecure JWT implementation â€” possible forgers
API key disclosure (apiKey)	May let you abuse internal APIs
Session cookies (refreshToken, idToken, accessToken)	Could allow session takeover or privilege escalation
